Software

<p>This page is an attempt at organization and, as some other parts of this site, is still a work in progress. I will be gradually uploading some of my production to <a href="http://www.github.com/raphaelss">my github account</a>. This shall be done with time as it requires some effort to organize and document programs that were either mostly meant to exist as-one off solutions to compositional and/or computational problems or specific for a composition and/or performance.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.github.com/raphaelss">My github account</a> should probably (eventually, at least) be the most complete collection of my software production. Below are descriptions of the most end user ready programs that could prove useful to other composers.</p>
<p>Building and/or running the programs should be straightforward. If you need help, send me an email at contact@raphaelss.com. Also, as most programs still haven't been uploaded, send me an email too if you're interested in something that's not on github.</p>
